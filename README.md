# Welcome to the Multilingual GitHub Project

🌍 **This is more than just a project. It's a message.**

You don’t need perfect English to create, collaborate, or contribute. In fact, most people rely on translation tools — and honestly, they’re not always smooth to use.

So we built this space.

A space where **you can start in your own language**. No pressure. No shame. Just the joy of building in your own words, your own pace, your own voice.

## 🙌 Start here (in your language)
Choose your preferred language:

- 🇬🇧 [English](🇬🇧🇺🇸🇨🇦 read me(en)read this‼️.md)
- 🇯🇵 [Japanese](🇯🇵 read me(jp)これ読んで‼️.md)
- 🇨🇳 [Chinese](🇨🇳 read me(zh)请阅读‼️.md)

> 🌐 **More languages available — look for your country’s flag in the files!**

## 🌟 Why this project matters
GitHub shouldn’t be a place only for insiders — it should be a shared square where anyone feels welcome.

- Got an idea? Share it.
- Found something to fix? Suggest it.
- Have something to say? **Say it in your own language.**

This project becomes richer with every person who joins.

> 🧠 If we already share a programming language, we should be able to create together — no matter what language we speak.
> Removing the language barrier from GitHub also removes the stress.
> Let’s use code as our shared language and build deeper connections from there.

## 🚀 How to join
1. Find the `read me(...)` file in your language
2. If it doesn’t exist yet, **make one and add it!**
3. Or just tell us which language you’d love to see

## 🌐 Help us spread the message on SNS!
If this project speaks to you, share it with the world.

Your voice might be the one that inspires someone else.

## 🌏 The world is made of many voices
Language isn’t a wall.  
It’s **your launchpad.**

Welcome.
